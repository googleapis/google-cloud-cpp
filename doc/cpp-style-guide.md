# C++ Style Guide for google-cloud-cpp

This project follows the [Google Style Guide][google-style-guide-link]
(hereafter GSG). In a few cases where the GSG gives latitude, we have made a
choice for consistency within this project. The following describes where we
differ from the GSG.

## Include Guards

All header files should have include guards formatted like `PROJECT_DIR_FILE_H`.
This differs from the advice in the GSG in that ours do not end with a trailing
underscore.

## Where to put `const`

Put the const on the right of what it modifies, as in `std::string const&`. This
simplifies the rules for const making it *always* modify what is on its left.
This is sometimes referred to as ["east const"][east-const-link].

## Pointer and Reference Expressions

Place the asterisk or ampersand adjacent to the type when declaring pointers or
references.

```C++
char* c;                 // GOOD
std::string const& str;  // GOOD

char *c;             // BAD
string const &str;   // BAD
string const & str;  // BAD
```

## Order of Includes

Order includes from local to global to minimize implicit dependencies between
headers. That is, start with the `.h` file that corresponds to the current `.cc`
file (also do this for the corresponding unit test file), followed by other `.h`
files from the same project, followed by includes from external projects,
followed by C++ standard library headers, followed by C system headers. For
example:

```C++
// Within the file google/cloud/x/foo.cc
#include "google/cloud/x/foo.h"
#include "google/cloud/x/bar.h"
#include "google/cloud/y/baz.h"
#include <grpcpp/blorg.h>
#include <google/bigtable/blah.h>
#include <map>
#include <vector>
#include <unistd.h>
```

This differs substantially from the corresponding section in the GSG, but we
feel the rule presented here is both simpler and better minimizes the implicit
dependencies exposed to each header.

## Legal Notice and Author Line

Every file should contain license boilerplate, for new files use:

```C++
// Copyright YYYY Google LLC
//
// Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");
// you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
// You may obtain a copy of the License at
//
//     https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0
//
// Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software
// distributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS,
// WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.
// See the License for the specific language governing permissions and
// limitations under the License.
```

where `YYYY` is the year when the file is being introduced. Do not change the
copyright line for existing files, even when they are moved.

## Doxygen Comments

Use Doxygen-style comments to document classes, functions, etc. Prefer
`@directives` over `\directives`. Do document the template parameters for
template classes. Use `///` for one-line Doxygen comments, use `/** */`
otherwise. Document all classes, functions, and symbols exposed as part of the
API of the library, even obvious ones.

## TODO Comments

Use `TODO` comments for code that is temporary, a short-term solution, or
good-enough but not perfect. All TODO comments should reference a github issue
and a brief description:

```
// TODO(#123) - here we need to randomize the sleep delayâ€¦.
```
