# Usage: macos-bazel.sh [bazel query expression]
#
# The build compiles the targets found via `bazel query`. Recall that:
#    bazel query //a/...
# returns the targets matching the pattern `//a/...`.` Furthermore, the
# expressions can be combined using `+` and `-`, so:
#    bazel query //a/... +//b/... -//a/c/...
# Returns the targets that match `//a/...` or `//b/...`, but not `//a/c/...`.
