# Helper tools to generate certain markdown files

The CI scripts and Dockerfiles are more complex than what most users care
about, they install development tools, such as code formatters, and drivers for
the integration tests. The instructions in our user-facing documentation are
intended to be minimal and to the point.

Verifying these instructions manually is very tedious, instead, we use
Docker as a scripting language to execute these instructions, and then
automatically reformat the "script" as markdown.

## HOWTO: Generate the markdown files

The markdown files are automatically generated by the `checker-pr` build. For
example, if you change docker files or build instructions, the markdown files
can be generated with the following command:

```bash
ci/cloudbuild/build.sh -t checkers-pr --docker
git status # should show the edited files
```

NOTE: You can manually run individual generator scripts as shown here:

```bash
ci/generate-markdown/generate-packaging.sh >doc/packaging.md
```
