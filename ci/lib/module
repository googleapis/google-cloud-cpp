# This bash library (even though it doesn't have the .sh extension) will be
# found when callers type `source module <file>` because init.sh added this
# directory to the caller's PATH. The <file> argument specified on the `source`
# line will be passed to this library as '$1'. We'll look for the caller's
# library by searching the MODULE_SEARCH_PATH array.
#
# This library does not use an include guard because it can, and should, be
# sourced many times. Therefore, this library must not define any global
# variables or functions.

  echo >&2 \
    "No MODULE_SEARCH_PATH set. " \
    "Did you forget to source init.sh, maybe from $0?"
