# This Dockerfile only contains the tools needed to run the `checkers.sh`
# build. The specific Linux distro and version don't really matter much, other
# than to the extent that certain distros offer certain versions of software
# that the build needs. It's fine to add more deps that are needed by the
# `checkers.sh` build.
