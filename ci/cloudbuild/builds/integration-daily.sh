# ATTENTION: This build is different than most because it's designed to be run
# as a "manual" trigger that's run on a schedule in GCB. It will be scheduled
# to run once a day. For details about scheduled manual triggers see
# https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/automating-builds/create-manual-triggers.
#
# NOTE: This build script will not have a trigger file in the
# `ci/cloudbuild/triggers` directory. "Manual" triggers exist only within the
# GCB UI at the time of this writing. Users with the appropriate access can run
# this build by hand with:
#   `ci/cloudbuild/build.sh --distro fedora-34 integration-daily --project cloud-cpp-testing-resources`
