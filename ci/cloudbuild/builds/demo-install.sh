# This build script serves two main purposes:
#
# 1. It demonstrates to users how to install `google-cloud-cpp`. We will
#    extract part of this script into user-facing markdown documentation.
# 2. It verifies that the installed artifacts work by compiling and running the
#    quickstart programs against the installed artifacts.
