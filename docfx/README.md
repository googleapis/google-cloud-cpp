# Doxygen XML to DocFX for google-cloud-cpp

This directory contains a tool to convert Doxygen XML into DocFX YAML files.
This tool is used to generate the `google-cloud-cpp` reference documentation
when hosted at cloud.google.com.

This is not a general-purpose tool. It is not expected to work for other C++
projects. This tool is only used as part of the documentation pipeline for
`google-cloud-cpp`. As such, it is only tested in a limited number of platforms.
