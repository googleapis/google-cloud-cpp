    google-cloud-cpp developers call this function from the top-level WORKSPACE
    file to obtain all the necessary *development* dependencies for
    google-cloud-cpp. This includes testing dependencies and dependencies used
    by development tools.

    It is a bug if the targets used for google-cloud-cpp can be used outside
    the package. All such targets should have their visibility restricted, or
    are deprecated. If you still need to use such targets, this function may
    be useful in your own WORKSPACE file.

    allowing developers to override the version of the dependencies they want to
    use.
