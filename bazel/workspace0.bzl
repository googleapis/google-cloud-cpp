    """Loads dependencies need to compile the google-cloud-cpp libraries.

    Application developers can call this function from their WORKSPACE file
    to obtain all the necessary dependencies for google-cloud-cpp, including
    gRPC and its dependencies. This function only loads dependencies that
    have not been previously loaded, allowing application developers to
    override the version of the dependencies they want to use.

    Note that some dependencies have their own `*_deps()` function. These
    functions can only be called after load()-ing the right .bzl file. Bazel
    does not permit interleaving load() and function calls in the same function
    or even the same `.bzl` file. Only the project's `WORKSPACE` file can
    interleave these calls.

    To workaround this limitation in Bazel we offer a series of helpers that can
    be loaded and called in sequence:

    ```
    http_archive(name = "google_cloud_cpp", ...)
    load("@google_cloud_cpp//bazel:workspace0.bzl", "gl_cpp_workspace0")
    gl_cpp_workspace0()
    load("@google_cloud_cpp//bazel:workspace1.bzl", "gl_cpp_workspace1")
    gl_cpp_workspace1()
    load("@google_cloud_cpp//bazel:workspace2.bzl", "gl_cpp_workspace2")
    gl_cpp_workspace2()
    load("@google_cloud_cpp//bazel:workspace3.bzl", "gl_cpp_workspace3")
    gl_cpp_workspace3()
    load("@google_cloud_cpp//bazel:workspace4.bzl", "gl_cpp_workspace4")
    gl_cpp_workspace4()
    load("@google_cloud_cpp//bazel:workspace5.bzl", "gl_cpp_workspace5")
    gl_cpp_workspace5()
    ```

    Args:
        name: Unused. It is conventional to provide a `name` argument to all
            workspace functions.
