# This build file overlays on top of the BUILD files for the googleapis repo,
# and it adds a target that lets us include their header files using
# angle-brackets, thus treating their headers as system includes. This allows
# us to dial-up the warnings in our own code, without seeing compiler warnings
# from their headers, which we do not own.
