  # Start these builds on pushes (think "after the merge") too. Normally there
  # are no `ci-gha**` branches in our repository. The contributors to the repo

  # without impacting the rest of the team.

  # "safe", as the workflow files are already committed. These types of builds
  # have access to the secrets in the build, which we need to use the remote
  # caches (Bazel and sccache).
