  // The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
  // either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are

  // `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*`
  // comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example,
  // to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can
  // also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
  // `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are
  // not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested
  // fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple

  // Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However,
