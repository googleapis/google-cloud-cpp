  // proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in
  // one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the
  // field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering.
  // The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
  // either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are
  // filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named
  // `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*`
  // comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example,
  // to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can
  // also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
  // `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are
  // not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested
  // fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple
  // expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For
  // example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel
  // Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However,
  // you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
  // (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
  // (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
  // expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
  // single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
  // multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
  // literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
  // quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
