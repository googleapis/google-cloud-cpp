// configuration to a limited set of load balancing proxies. Proxies and
// sidecars involved in load balancing would typically present metadata to the
// load balancers that need to match criteria specified here. If a match takes
// place, the relevant configuration is made available to those proxies. For
// each metadataFilter in this list, if its filterMatchCriteria is set to
// MATCH_ANY, at least one of the filterLabels must match the corresponding
// label provided in the metadata. If its filterMatchCriteria is set to
// MATCH_ALL, then all of its filterLabels must match with corresponding labels

// load balancing involves Envoys, they receive routing configuration when
// values in metadataFilters match values supplied in of their XDS requests to
// loadbalancers.
