  // included on requests with safe HTTP methods (GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE)
  // without query parameters. Requests that send Early Data with non-idempotent
  // HTTP methods or with query parameters will be rejected with a HTTP 425.
  // UNRESTRICTED: This enables TLS 1.3 Early Data for requests with any HTTP
  // method including non-idempotent methods list POST. This mode does not
