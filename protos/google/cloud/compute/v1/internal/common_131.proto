  // connections over TCP (HTTP/2) as well as over UDP (QUIC/h3). This can
  // improve application performance, especially on networks where interruptions
  // may be common, such as on mobile. Requests with Early Data will have the

  // the backend to determine whether Early Data was included. Note: TLS Early
  // Data may allow requests to be replayed, as the data is sent to the backend
  // before the handshake has fully completed. Applications that allow
  // idempotent HTTP methods to make non-idempotent changes, such as a GET
  // request updating a database, should not accept Early Data on those
  // requests, and reject requests with the "Early-Data: 1" HTTP header by
  // returning a HTTP 425 (Too Early) status code, in order to remain RFC
  // compliant. The default value is DISABLED.
  // DISABLED: TLS 1.3 Early Data is not advertised, and any (invalid) attempts
  // to send Early Data will be rejected by closing the connection.
  // PERMISSIVE: This enables TLS 1.3 0-RTT, and only allows Early Data to be
  // included on requests with safe HTTP methods (GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE).
  // This mode does not enforce any other limitations for requests with Early
  // Data. The application owner should validate that Early Data is acceptable
  // for a given request path.

  // included on requests with safe HTTP methods (GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE)
  // without query parameters. Requests that send Early Data with non-idempotent
  // HTTP methods or with query parameters will be rejected with a HTTP 425.
  // UNRESTRICTED: This enables TLS 1.3 Early Data for requests with any HTTP
  // method including non-idempotent methods list POST. This mode does not
  // enforce any other limitations. This may be valuable for gRPC use cases.
