# Creating a new release of google-cloud-cpp

Unless there are no changes, we create releases for `google-cloud-cpp` at the
beginning of each month, usually on the first business day. We also create
releases if there is a major announcement or change to the status of one
of the libraries (like reaching the "Alpha" or "Beta" milestone).

The intended audience of this document are developers in the `google-cloud-cpp`
project that need to create a new release. We expect the reader to be familiar
the project itself, [git][git-docs], [GitHub][github-guides], and
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org).

## Preparing for a release

To create a new release you need to perform some maintenance tasks, these are
enumerated below.

### Verify CI passing

Before beginning the release process, verify all CI builds are passing on
the `main` branch. This is displayed in the GitHub page for the project.

### Update the API baseline

Run the `check-api` build to update the API baseline. Once you cut the release
any new APIs are, well, released, and we should think carefully about removing
them.

```bash
ci/cloudbuild/build.sh -t check-api-pr --docker
```

The updated ABI dump files will be left in the `ci/abi-dumps` folder.

This may take a while, leave it running while you perform the next step. You
can, but are not required to, send a single PR to update the baseline and the
`CHANGELOG.md` file.

### Update CHANGELOG.md

Assuming you are working on your own fork of the `google-cloud-cpp` project,
and `upstream` points to the `googleapis/google-cloud-cpp` remote, these
commands should be useful in identifying important changes for inclusion in the
release notes.

Update `CHANGELOG.md` based on the release notes for Bigtable, Storage,
Spanner, and the common libraries:

```bash
# Summarize the output of this into CHANGELOG.md under the "Bigtable" header
git log --no-merges --format="format:* %s" \
    $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0 upstream/main)..HEAD \
    upstream/main -- google/cloud/bigtable
```

```bash
# Summarize the output of this into CHANGELOG.md under the "Pub/Sub" header
git log --no-merges --format="format:* %s" \
    $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0 upstream/main)..HEAD \
    upstream/main -- google/cloud/pubsub
```

```bash
# Summarize the output of this into CHANGELOG.md under the "Storage" header
git log --no-merges --format="format:* %s" \
    $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0 upstream/main)..HEAD \
    upstream/main -- google/cloud/storage
```

```bash
# Summarize the output of this into CHANGELOG.md under the "Spanner" header
git log --no-merges --format="format:* %s" \
    $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0 upstream/main)..HEAD \
    upstream/main -- google/cloud/spanner
```

```bash
# Summarize the output of this into CHANGELOG.md under the "Common libraries" header
git log --no-merges --format="format:* %s" \
    $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0 upstream/main)..HEAD \
    upstream/main -- google/cloud \
   ':(exclude)google/cloud/firestore/' \
   ':(exclude)google/cloud/bigtable/' \
   ':(exclude)google/cloud/pubsub/' \
   ':(exclude)google/cloud/spanner/' \
   ':(exclude)google/cloud/storage/'
```

Any **chore**/**ci**/**test**-tagged PRs in the above lists should probably be
discarded as they are uninteresting to our users.

### Send a PR with all these changes

In general, do not create the release branch before this PR is *merged*. We want
to create the release from a stable point in the default branch (`main`), and
we want this point to include the updated release notes and API baselines.
There may be exceptions to this guideline, you are encouraged to use your own
judgment.

## Creating the release

> :warning: the `release.sh` script was broken as of 2021-07.
> See [#6682] for details

[#6682]: https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-cpp/issues/6682

We next need to create the release tag, the release branch, and create the
release in the GitHub UI. We use a script ([`release/release.sh`]) to automate
said steps.

[`release/release.sh`]: https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-cpp/blob/main/release/release.sh

*No PR is needed for this step.*

First run the following command -- which will *NOT* make any changes to any
repos -- and verify that the output and *version numbers* look correct.

```bash
$ release/release.sh googleapis/google-cloud-cpp
```

If the output from the previous command looks OK, rerun the command with the
`-f` flag, which will make the changes and push them to the remote repo.

```bash
$ release/release.sh -f googleapis/google-cloud-cpp
```

**NOTE:** This script can be run from any directory. It operates only on the
specified repo.

### Publish the release

Review the new release in the GitHub web UI (the link to the pre-release will
be output from the `release.sh` script that was run in the previous step). If
everything looks OK, uncheck the pre-release checkbox and publish.

## Check the published docs on googleapis.dev

The `publish-docs` build should start automatically when you create the release
branch. This build will upload the docs for the new release to the following
URLs:

* https://googleapis.dev/cpp/google-cloud-bigtable/latest/
* https://googleapis.dev/cpp/google-cloud-pubsub/latest/
* https://googleapis.dev/cpp/google-cloud-storage/latest/
* https://googleapis.dev/cpp/google-cloud-spanner/latest/
* https://googleapis.dev/cpp/google-cloud-common/latest/

It can take up to an hour after the build finishes for the new docs to show up
at the above URLs. You can watch the status of the build at
https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds?project=cloud-cpp-testing-resources&query=tags%3D%22publish-docs%22

## Bump the version numbers in `main`

Working in your fork of `google-cloud-cpp`: bump the version numbers to the
*next* version, i.e., one version past the release you just did above. Then
send the PR for review against `main`. You need to:

- Update the version numbers in the top-level `CMakeLists.txt` file.
- Run the cmake configuration step, this will update the different
  `version_info.h` files.
- Update the version number and SHA256 checksums in the
  `google/cloud/*/quickstart/WORKSPACE` files to point to the *just-released*
  version.

## Review the protections for the `v[0-9].*` branches

We use the [GitHub Branch Settings][github-branch-settings] to protect the
release branches against accidental mistakes. From time to time changes in the
release branch naming conventions may require you to change these settings.
Please note that we use more strict settings for release branches than for
`main`, in particular:

* We require at least one review, but stale reviews are dismissed.
* The `Require status checks to pass before merging` option is set.
  This prevents merges into the release branches that break the build.
  * The `Require branches to be up to date before merging` sub-option
    is set. This prevents two merges that do not conflict, but nevertheless
    break if both are pushed, to actually merge.
  * _At a minimum_ the `cla/google`, `asan-pr`, and `clang-tidy-pr` checks should
    be marked as "required". You may consider adding additional builds if it
    would prevent embarrassing failures, but consider the tradeoff of merges
    blocked by flaky builds.

* The `Include administrators` checkbox is turned on, we want to stop ourselves
  from making mistakes.

* Turn on the `Restrict who can push to matching branches`. Only Google team
  members should be pushing to release branches.

## Push the release to Microsoft vcpkg

Nudge `coryan@` to update our [vcpkg port]. These updates are not difficult, but
contributing to this repository requires SVP approval. If you want, you can
seek approval to make such updates yourself, just keep in mind that this may
take several weeks.

# Creating a patch release of google-cloud-cpp on an existing release branch

In your development fork:
* Switch to the existing release branch, e.g. `git checkout v1.17.x`.
* Create a new branch off the release branch.
* Create or cherry-pick commits with the desired changes.
* Update `CHANELOG.md` to reflect the changes made.
* Bump the minor version number in the top-level CMakeLists.txt and run the
  cmake configuration step to update the different `version_info.h` files.
* After merging the PR(s) with all the above changes, use the Release UI on
  GitHub to create a pre-release along with a new tag for the release.
* After review, publish the release.
* Nudge `coryan@` to update our [vcpkg port].
