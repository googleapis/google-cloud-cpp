# AlloyDB API C++ Client Library

This directory contains an idiomatic C++ client library for the
[AlloyDB API][cloud-service-docs], a service to AlloyDB for PostgreSQL is an open source-compatible database service that provides a powerful option for migrating, modernizing, or building commercial-grade applications. It offers full compatibility with standard PostgreSQL, and is more than 4x faster for transactional workloads and up to 100x faster for analytical queries than standard PostgreSQL in our performance tests. AlloyDB for PostgreSQL offers a 99.99 percent availability SLA inclusive of maintenance. <br><br> AlloyDB is optimized for the most demanding use cases, allowing you to build new applications that require high transaction throughput, large database sizes, or multiple read resources; scale existing PostgreSQL workloads with no application changes; and modernize legacy proprietary databases.

While this library is **GA**, please note that the Google Cloud C++ client
libraries do **not** follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Quickstart

The [quickstart/](quickstart/README.md) directory contains a minimal environment
to get started using this client library in a larger project. The following
"Hello World" program is used in this quickstart, and should give you a taste of
this library.

<!-- inject-quickstart-start -->

```cc
#include "google/cloud/alloydb/ EDIT HERE .h"
#include "google/cloud/project.h"
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) try {
  if (argc != 2) {
    std::cerr << "Usage: " << argv[0] << " project-id\n";
    return 1;
  }

  namespace alloydb = ::google::cloud::alloydb;
  auto client = alloydb::Client(alloydb::MakeConnection());

  auto const project = google::cloud::Project(argv[1]);
  for (auto r : client.List /*EDIT HERE*/ (project.FullName())) {
    if (!r) throw std::move(r).status();
    std::cout << r->DebugString() << "\n";
  }

  return 0;
} catch (google::cloud::Status const& status) {
  std::cerr << "google::cloud::Status thrown: " << status << "\n";
  return 1;
}
```
