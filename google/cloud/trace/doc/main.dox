@mainpage Cloud Trace API C++ Client Library

An idiomatic C++ client library for the [Cloud Trace API][cloud-service-docs],
a service to send application trace data to Cloud Trace for viewing. This
library is used to interact with the Trace API directly. If you are looking to
instrument your application for Cloud Trace, we recommend using
[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) or a similar framework.

While this library is **GA**, please note Google Cloud C++ client libraries do **not** follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Quickstart

The following shows the code that you'll run in the
`google/cloud/trace/quickstart/` directory,
which should give you a taste of the Cloud Trace API C++ client library API.

@snippet quickstart.cc all

## Main classes

<!-- inject-client-list-start -->
This library offers multiple `*Client` classes, which are listed below. Each
one of these classes exposes all the RPCs for a gRPC `service` as member
functions of the class. This library groups multiple gRPC services because they
are part of the same product or are often used together. A typical example may
be the administrative and data plane operations for a single product.

The library also has other classes that provide helpers, retry policies,
configuration parameters, and infrastructure to mock the `*Client` classes
when testing your application.

- [\c trace_v1::TraceServiceClient](@ref google::cloud::trace_v1::TraceServiceClient)
- [\c trace_v2::TraceServiceClient](@ref google::cloud::trace_v2::TraceServiceClient)
<!-- inject-client-list-end -->

## Retry, Backoff, and Idempotency Policies.

The library automatically retries requests that fail with transient errors, and
uses [exponential backoff] to backoff between retries. Application developers
can override the default policies.

## More Information

- @ref common-error-handling - describes how the library reports errors.
- @ref trace-override-endpoint - describes how to override the default
  endpoint.
- @ref trace-override-authentication - describes how to change the
  authentication credentials used by the library.
- @ref trace-env - describes environment variables that can configure the behavior of the library.
