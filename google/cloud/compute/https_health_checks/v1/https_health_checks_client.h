/// @par Equality
///
/// Instances of this class created via copy-construction or copy-assignment
/// always compare equal. Instances created with equal
/// `std::shared_ptr<*Connection>` objects compare equal. Objects that compare
/// equal share the same underlying resources.
///
/// @par Performance
///
/// Creating a new instance of this class is a relatively expensive operation,
/// new objects establish new connections to the service. In contrast,
/// copy-construction, move-construction, and the corresponding assignment
/// operations are relatively efficient as the copies share all underlying
/// resources.
///
/// @par Thread Safety
///
/// Concurrent access to different instances of this class, even if they compare
/// equal, is guaranteed to work. Two or more threads operating on the same
/// instance of this class is not guaranteed to work. Since copy-construction
/// and move-construction is a relatively efficient operation, consider using
/// such a copy when using this class from multiple threads.
