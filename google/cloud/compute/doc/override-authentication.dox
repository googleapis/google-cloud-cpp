@page compute-override-authentication How to Override the Authentication Credentials

Unless otherwise configured, the client libraries use
[Application Default Credentials] to authenticate with Google Cloud Services.
While this works for most applications, in some cases you may need to override
this default. You can do so by providing the
[UnifiedCredentialsOption](@ref google::cloud::UnifiedCredentialsOption)
The following example shows how to explicitly load a service account key file:

<!-- inject-service-account-snippet-start -->
@snippet disks_client_samples.cc with-service-account

<!-- inject-service-account-snippet-end -->

Keep in mind that we chose this as an example because it is relatively easy to
understand. Consult the [Best practices for managing service account keys]
guide for more details.

@see @ref guac - for more information on the factory functions to create
`google::cloud::Credentials` objects.
