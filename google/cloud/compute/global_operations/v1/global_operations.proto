  // the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for
  // filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
  // must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you
  // are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named
  // `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:`
  // operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
  // fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be
  // used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all
  // objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter
  // nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart
  // = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic
  // restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
  // resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
  // expression within parentheses. For example: ```
  // (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By
  // default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include

  // "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND

  // expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
  // single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
