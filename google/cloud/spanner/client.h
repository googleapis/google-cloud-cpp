/**
 * Performs database client operations on Spanner.
 *
 * Applications use this class to perform operations on
 * [Spanner Databases][spanner-doc-link].
 *
 * @par Performance
 *
 * `Client` objects are relatively cheap to create, copy, and move. However,
 * each `Client` object must be created with a `std::shared_ptr<Connection>`,
 * which itself is relatively expensive to create. Therefore, connection
 * instances should be shared when possible. See the `MakeConnection()` method
 * and the `Connection` interface for more details.
 *
 * @par Thread Safety
 *
 * Instances of this class created via copy-construction or copy-assignment
 * share the underlying pool of connections. Access to these copies via multiple
 * threads is guaranteed to work. Two threads operating on the same instance of
 * this class is not guaranteed to work.
 *
 * @par Error Handling
 *
 * This class uses `StatusOr<T>` to report errors. When an operation fails to
 * perform its work the returned `StatusOr<T>` contains the error details. If
 * the `ok()` member function in the `StatusOr<T>` returns `true` then it
 * contains the expected result. Please consult the
 * [`StatusOr<T>` documentation](#google::cloud::v0::StatusOr) for more details.
 *
 * @code
 * namespace spanner = ::google::cloud::spanner;
 *
 * auto db = spanner::Database("my_project", "my_instance", "my_db_id"));
 * auto conn = spanner::MakeConnection(db);
 * auto client = spanner::Client(conn);
 *
 * auto rows = client.Read(...);
 * using RowType = std::tuple<std::int64_t, std::string>;
 * for (auto const& row : spanner::StreamOf<RowType>(rows)) {
 *   // ...
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @par Query Options
 *
 * Most operations that take an `SqlStatement` may also be modified with
 * `QueryOptions`. These options can be set at various levels, with more
 * specific levels taking precedence over broader ones. For example,
 * `QueryOptions` that are passed directly to `Client::ExecuteQuery()` will
 * take precedence over the `Client`-level defaults (if any), which will
 * themselves take precedence over any environment variables. The following
 * table shows the environment variables that may optionally be set and the
 * `QueryOptions` setting that they affect.
 *
 * Environment Variable                   | QueryOptions setting
 * -------------------------------------- | --------------------
 * `SPANNER_OPTIMIZER_VERSION`            | `QueryOptions::optimizer_version()`
 * `SPANNER_OPTIMIZER_STATISTICS_PACKAGE` | `QueryOptions::optimizer_statistics_package()`
 *
 * @see https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/reference/rest/v1/QueryOptions
