# Google Cloud Spanner C++ Client Library

<!-- This file is automatically generated by ci/generate-markdown/generate-spanner-readme.sh -->

This directory contains an idiomatic C++ client library for interacting with
[Google Cloud Spanner](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/), which is a fully
managed, scalable, relational database service for regional and global
application data.

Please note that the Google Cloud C++ client libraries do **not** follow
[Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## Supported Platforms

* Windows, macOS, Linux
* C++11 (and higher) compilers (we test with GCC \>= 4.9, Clang >= 3.8, and MSVC \>= 2019)
* Environments with or without exceptions
* Bazel and CMake builds

## Documentation

* Official documentation about the [Cloud Spanner][cloud-spanner-docs] service
* [Reference doxygen documentation][doxygen-link] for each release of this client library
* Detailed header comments in our [public `.h`][source-link] files

## Quickstart

The [quickstart/](quickstart/README.md) directory contains a minimal environment
to get started using this client library in a larger project. The following
"Hello World" program is used in this quickstart, and should give you a taste of
this library.

```cc
#include "google/cloud/spanner/client.h"
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) try {
  if (argc != 4) {
    std::cerr << "Usage: " << argv[0]
              << " project-id instance-id database-id\n";
    return 1;
  }

  namespace spanner = ::google::cloud::spanner;
  spanner::Client client(
      spanner::MakeConnection(spanner::Database(argv[1], argv[2], argv[3])));

  auto rows =
      client.ExecuteQuery(spanner::SqlStatement("SELECT 'Hello World'"));

  for (auto const& row : spanner::StreamOf<std::tuple<std::string>>(rows)) {
    if (!row) throw std::runtime_error(row.status().message());
    std::cout << std::get<0>(*row) << "\n";
  }

  return 0;
} catch (std::exception const& ex) {
  std::cerr << "Standard exception raised: " << ex.what() << "\n";
  return 1;
}

* Packaging maintainers or developers that prefer to install the library in a
  fixed directory (such as `/usr/local` or `/opt`) should consult the
  [packaging guide](/doc/packaging.md).
* Developers wanting to use the libraries as part of a larger CMake or Bazel
  project should consult the [quickstart guides](#quickstart) for the library
  or libraries they want to use.
* Developers wanting to compile the library just to run some of the examples or
  tests should read the current document.
* Contributors and developers to `google-cloud-cpp` should consult the guide to
  [setup a development workstation][howto-setup-dev-workstation].
