/**
 * Implements service account credentials for REST clients.
 *
 * This class is not intended for use by application developers. But it is
 * sufficiently complex that it deserves documentation for library developers.
 *
 * This class description assumes that you are familiar with [service accounts],
 * and [service account keys].
 *
 * Use `ParseServiceAccountCredentials()` to parse a service account key. If the
 * key is parsed successfully, you can create an instance of this class using
 * its result.
 * The service account key is never sent to Google for authentication. Instead,
 * this class creates temporary access tokens, either self-signed JWT (as
 * described in [aip/4111]), or OAuth access tokens (see [aip/4112]).
 *
 * To understand how these work it is useful to be familiar with [JWTs]. If you
 * already know what these, feel free to skip this paragraph. JWTs are
 * (relatively long) strings consisting of three (base64-encoded) components.
 * The first two are base64 encoded JSON objects. These fields in these objects
 * are often referred as "claims".  For example, the `iat` (Issued At-Time)
 * field, asserts or claims that the token was created at a certain time. The
 * third component in a JWT is a signature created using some secret. In our
 * case the signature is always created using the [RS256] signing algorithm.
 * One of the claims is always the
 * identifier for the service account key. Google Cloud has the public key
 * associated with each service account key and can use this to verify that the
 * JWT was actually signed by the service account key claimed by the JWT.
 *
 * With self-signed JWT, the token is created locally, the payload contains
 * either an audience (`"aud"`) or scope (`"scope"`) claim (but not both)
 * describing the service or services that the token grants access to. Setting
 * a more restrictive scope or audience allows applications to create tokens
 * that restrict the access for a service account. This class **only** supports
 * scope-based self-signed JWTs.
 *
 * With OAuth-based access tokens the client library creates a JWT and makes a
 * HTTP request to convert this JWT into an access token. In general,
 * self-signed JWTs are preferred over OAuth-based access tokens. On the other
 * hand, our implementation of OAuth-based access tokens has more flight hours,
 * and has been tested in more environments (on-prem, VPC-SC with different
 * restrictions, etc.).
 *
 * The `GOOGLE_CLOUD_CPP_EXPERIMENTAL_DISABLE_SELF_SIGNED_JWT` environment
 * variable can be used to prefer OAuth-based access tokens.
 *
 * Since access tokens are relatively expensive to create this class caches the
 * access tokens until they are about to expire. Use the `AuthorizationHeader()`
 * to get the current access token.
