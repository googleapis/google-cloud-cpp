/**
 * Report errors loading credentials when the RPC is called.
 *
 * With the "unified authentication client" approach the application just
 * declares its *intent*, e.g., "load the default credentials", the actual work
 * is delayed and depends on how the client library is implemented. We also want
 * the behavior with gRPC and REST to be as similar as possible.
 *
 * For some credential types (e.g. service account impersonation) there may be
 * problems with the credentials that are not manifest until after several RPCs
 * succeed.
 *
 * For gRPC, creating the credentials always succeeds, but using them may fail.
 *
 * With REST we typically validate the credentials when loaded, and then again
 * when we try to use them.
 *
 * This last approach was problematic, because it made some credentials fail
 * early. This class allows us to treat all credentials, including REST
 * credentials that failed to load as "evaluated at RPC time".
