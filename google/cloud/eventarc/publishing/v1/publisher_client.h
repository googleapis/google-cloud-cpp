///
/// Eventarc processes events generated by an event provider and delivers them
/// to a subscriber.
///
/// An event provider is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) system or
/// product that can generate and deliver events through Eventarc.
///
/// A third-party event provider is an event provider from outside of Google.
///
/// A partner is a third-party event provider that is integrated with Eventarc.
///
/// A subscriber is a GCP customer interested in receiving events.
///
/// Channel is a first-class Eventarc resource that is created and managed
/// by the subscriber in their Google Cloud project. A Channel represents a
/// subscriber's intent to receive events from an event provider. A Channel is
/// associated with exactly one event provider.
///
/// ChannelConnection is a first-class Eventarc resource that
/// is created and managed by the partner in their Google Cloud project. A
/// ChannelConnection represents a connection between a partner and a
/// subscriber's Channel. A ChannelConnection has a one-to-one mapping with a
/// Channel.
///
/// Bus is a first-class Eventarc resource that is created and managed in a
/// Google Cloud project. A Bus provides a discoverable endpoint for events and
/// is a router that receives all events published by event providers and
/// delivers them to zero or more subscribers.
///
/// Publisher allows an event provider to publish events to Eventarc.
///
/// @par Equality
///
/// Instances of this class created via copy-construction or copy-assignment
/// always compare equal. Instances created with equal
/// `std::shared_ptr<*Connection>` objects compare equal. Objects that compare
/// equal share the same underlying resources.
///
/// @par Performance
///
/// Creating a new instance of this class is a relatively expensive operation,
/// new objects establish new connections to the service. In contrast,
/// copy-construction, move-construction, and the corresponding assignment
/// operations are relatively efficient as the copies share all underlying
/// resources.
///
/// @par Thread Safety
///
/// Concurrent access to different instances of this class, even if they compare
/// equal, is guaranteed to work. Two or more threads operating on the same
/// instance of this class is not guaranteed to work. Since copy-construction
/// and move-construction is a relatively efficient operation, consider using
/// such a copy when using this class from multiple threads.
