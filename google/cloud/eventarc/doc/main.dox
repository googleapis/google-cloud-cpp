@mainpage Eventarc API C++ Client Library

service to asynchronously deliver events.

While this library is **GA**, please note Google Cloud C++ client libraries do **not** follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Quickstart

The following shows the code that you'll run in the
`google/cloud/eventarc/quickstart/` directory,
which should give you a taste of the Eventarc API C++ client library API.

## Main classes

<!-- inject-client-list-start -->
This library offers multiple `*Client` classes, which are listed below. Each one
of these classes exposes all the RPCs for a service as member functions of the
class. This library groups multiple services because they are part of the same
product or are often used together. A typical example may be the administrative
and data plane operations for a single product.

The library also has other classes that provide helpers, configuration
parameters, and infrastructure to mock the `*Client` classes when testing your
application.

- [\c eventarc_publishing_v1::PublisherClient](@ref google::cloud::eventarc_publishing_v1::PublisherClient)
- [\c eventarc_v1::EventarcClient](@ref google::cloud::eventarc_v1::EventarcClient)
<!-- inject-client-list-end -->
