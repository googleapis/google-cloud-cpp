/// equal share the same underlying resources.
///
/// @par Performance
///
/// Creating a new instance of this class is a relatively expensive operation,
/// new objects establish new connections to the service. In contrast,

/// operations are relatively efficient as the copies share all underlying

/// Concurrent access to different instances of this class, even if they compare
/// equal, is guaranteed to work. Two or more threads operating on the same
/// instance of this class is not guaranteed to work. Since copy-construction
/// and move-construction is a relatively efficient operation, consider using
/// such a copy when using this class from multiple threads.

  ///  For example, to set the version of scikit-learn to install in the
  ///  environment to 0.19.0 and to remove an existing installation of
  ///  numpy, the `updateMask` parameter would include the following two
  ///  `paths` values: "config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages.scikit-learn" and
  ///  "config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages.numpy". The included patch
  ///  environment would specify the scikit-learn version as follows:
  ///  @n
  ///      {
  ///        "config":{
  ///          "softwareConfig":{
  ///            "pypiPackages":{

  ///            }
  ///          }
  ///        }
  ///      }
  ///  @n
  ///  Note that in the above example, any existing PyPI packages
  ///  other than scikit-learn and numpy will be unaffected.
  ///  @n
  ///  Only one update type may be included in a single request's `updateMask`.
  ///  For example, one cannot update both the PyPI packages and
  ///  labels in the same request. However, it is possible to update multiple
  ///  members of a map field simultaneously in the same request. For example,
  ///  to set the labels "label1" and "label2" while clearing "label3" (assuming
  ///  it already exists), one can
  ///  provide the paths "labels.label1", "labels.label2", and "labels.label3"
  ///  and populate the patch environment as follows:
  ///  @n
  ///      {
  ///        "labels":{
  ///          "label1":"new-label1-value"
  ///          "label2":"new-label2-value"
  ///        }
  ///      }
  ///  @n
  ///  Note that in the above example, any existing labels that are not
  ///  included in the `updateMask` will be unaffected.
  ///  @n
  ///  It is also possible to replace an entire map field by providing the
  ///  map field's path in the `updateMask`. The new value of the field will
  ///  be that which is provided in the patch environment. For example, to
  ///  delete all pre-existing user-specified PyPI packages and
  ///  install botocore at version 1.7.14, the `updateMask` would contain
  ///  the path "config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages", and
  ///  the patch environment would be the following:
  ///  @n
  ///      {
  ///        "config":{
  ///          "softwareConfig":{
  ///            "pypiPackages":{
  ///              "botocore":"==1.7.14"
  ///            }
  ///          }
  ///        }
  ///      }
  ///  @n
  ///  **Note:** Only the following fields can be updated:
  ///  @n
  ///  * `config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages`
  ///      * Replace all custom custom PyPI packages. If a replacement
