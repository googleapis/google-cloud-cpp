@mainpage Cloud Talent Solution C++ Client Library

An idiomatic C++ client library for the [Cloud Talent Solution][cloud-service-docs],
a suite of APIs that allow you to create and manage jobs and profiles in the
talent industry.

While this library is **GA**, please note Google Cloud C++ client libraries do **not** follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Quickstart

The following shows the code that you'll run in the
`google/cloud/talent/quickstart/` directory,
which should give you a taste of the Cloud Talent Solution C++ client library API.

## Main classes

<!-- inject-client-list-start -->
This library offers multiple `*Client` classes, which are listed below. Each
one of these classes exposes all the RPCs for a gRPC `service` as member
functions of the class. This library groups multiple gRPC services because they
are part of the same product or are often used together. A typical example may
be the administrative and data plane operations for a single product.

The library also has other classes that provide helpers, retry policies,
configuration parameters, and infrastructure to mock the `*Client` classes
when testing your application.

- [`talent_v4::CompanyServiceClient`](@ref google::cloud::talent_v4::CompanyServiceClient)
- [`talent_v4::CompletionClient`](@ref google::cloud::talent_v4::CompletionClient)
- [`talent_v4::EventServiceClient`](@ref google::cloud::talent_v4::EventServiceClient)
- [`talent_v4::JobServiceClient`](@ref google::cloud::talent_v4::JobServiceClient)
- [`talent_v4::TenantServiceClient`](@ref google::cloud::talent_v4::TenantServiceClient)
<!-- inject-client-list-end -->


## Retry, Backoff, and Idempotency Policies.

The library automatically retries requests that fail with transient errors, and
uses [exponential backoff] to backoff between retries. Application developers
can override the default policies.

## More Information

- @ref common-error-handling - describes how the library reports errors.
