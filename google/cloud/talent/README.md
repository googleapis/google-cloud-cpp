# Cloud Talent Solution API C++ Client Library

This directory contains an idiomatic C++ client library for
[Cloud Talent Solution][cloud-service-docs], a suite of APIs that allow you to
create and manage jobs and profiles in the talent industry.

While this library is **GA**, please note that the Google Cloud C++ client libraries do **not** follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Supported Platforms

- Windows, macOS, Linux
- C++14 (and higher) compilers (we test with GCC >= 7.3, Clang >= 6.0, and
  MSVC >= 2017)
- Environments with or without exceptions
- Bazel (>= 4.0) and CMake (>= 3.5) builds

## Documentation

- Official documentation about the [Cloud Talent Solution API][cloud-service-docs] service
- [Reference doxygen documentation][doxygen-link] for each release of this
  client library
- Detailed header comments in our [public `.h`][source-link] files

## Quickstart

The [quickstart/](quickstart/README.md) directory contains a minimal environment
to get started using this client library in a larger project. The following
"Hello World" program is used in this quickstart, and should give you a taste of
this library.

<!-- inject-quickstart-start -->

```cc
#include "google/cloud/talent/company_client.h"
#include "google/cloud/project.h"
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) try {
  if (argc != 2) {
    std::cerr << "Usage: " << argv[0] << " project-id\n";
    return 1;
  }

  namespace talent = ::google::cloud::talent;
  auto client =
      talent::CompanyServiceClient(talent::MakeCompanyServiceConnection());

  auto const project = google::cloud::Project(argv[1]);
  for (auto c : client.ListCompanies(project.FullName())) {
    if (!c) throw std::runtime_error(c.status().message());
    std::cout << c->DebugString() << "\n";
  }

  return 0;
} catch (std::exception const& ex) {
  std::cerr << "Standard exception raised: " << ex.what() << "\n";
  return 1;
}
```

<!-- inject-quickstart-end -->

- Packaging maintainers or developers who prefer to install the library in a
  fixed directory (such as `/usr/local` or `/opt`) should consult the
  [packaging guide](/doc/packaging.md).
- Developers wanting to use the libraries as part of a larger CMake or Bazel
  project should consult the [quickstart guides](#quickstart) for the library
  or libraries they want to use.
- Developers wanting to compile the library just to run some of the examples or
  tests should read the current document.
- Contributors and developers to `google-cloud-cpp` should consult the guide to
  [setup a development workstation][howto-setup-dev-workstation].
