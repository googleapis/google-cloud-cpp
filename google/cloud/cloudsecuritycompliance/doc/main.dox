## Quickstart

The following shows the code that you'll run in the
`google/cloud/cloudsecuritycompliance/quickstart/` directory,
which should give you a taste of the Cloud Security Compliance API C++ client library API.

@snippet quickstart.cc all

## Main classes

<!-- inject-client-list-start -->
This library offers multiple `*Client` classes, which are listed below. Each one
of these classes exposes all the RPCs for a service as member functions of the
class. This library groups multiple services because they are part of the same
product or are often used together. A typical example may be the administrative
and data plane operations for a single product.

The library also has other classes that provide helpers, configuration
parameters, and infrastructure to mock the `*Client` classes when testing your
application.

- [\c cloudsecuritycompliance_v1::ConfigClient](@ref google::cloud::cloudsecuritycompliance_v1::ConfigClient)
- [\c cloudsecuritycompliance_v1::DeploymentClient](@ref google::cloud::cloudsecuritycompliance_v1::DeploymentClient)
<!-- inject-client-list-end -->
