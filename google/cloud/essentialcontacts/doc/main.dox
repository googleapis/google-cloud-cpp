## Main classes

<!-- inject-client-list-start -->
The main class in this library is
[`essentialcontacts_v1::EssentialContactsServiceClient`](@ref google::cloud::essentialcontacts_v1::EssentialContactsServiceClient). All RPCs are exposed
as member functions of this class. Other classes provide helpers, configuration
parameters, and infrastructure to mock
[`essentialcontacts_v1::EssentialContactsServiceClient`](@ref google::cloud::essentialcontacts_v1::EssentialContactsServiceClient) when testing your
application.
<!-- inject-client-list-end -->

## Retry, Backoff, and Idempotency Policies.

The library automatically retries requests that fail with transient errors, and
uses [exponential backoff] to backoff between retries. Application developers
can override the default policies.
