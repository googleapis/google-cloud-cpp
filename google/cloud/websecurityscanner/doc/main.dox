@mainpage Web Security Scanner API C++ Client Library

An idiomatic C++ client library for
[Web Security Scanner](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/), a
service that scans your Compute and App Engine apps for common web
vulnerabilities.

While this library is **GA**, please note Google Cloud C++ client libraries do **not** follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Quickstart

The following shows the code that you'll run in the
`google/cloud/websecurityscanner/quickstart/` directory,
which should give you a taste of the Web Security Scanner API C++ client library API.

## Main classes

<!-- inject-client-list-start -->
The main class in this library is
[\c websecurityscanner_v1::WebSecurityScannerClient](@ref google::cloud::websecurityscanner_v1::WebSecurityScannerClient).
All RPCs are exposed as member functions of this class. Other classes provide
helpers, retry policies, configuration parameters, and infrastructure to mock
[\c websecurityscanner_v1::WebSecurityScannerClient](@ref google::cloud::websecurityscanner_v1::WebSecurityScannerClient) when testing your
application.
<!-- inject-client-list-end -->

## Retry, Backoff, and Idempotency Policies.

The library automatically retries requests that fail with transient errors, and
uses [exponential backoff] to backoff between retries. Application developers
can override the default policies.

## More Information

- @ref common-error-handling - describes how the library reports errors.
- @ref websecurityscanner-override-endpoint - describes how to override the default
  endpoint.
- @ref websecurityscanner-override-authentication - describes how to change the
  authentication credentials used by the library.
