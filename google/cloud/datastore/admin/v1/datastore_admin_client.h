///
/// Google Cloud Datastore Admin API
///
/// The Datastore Admin API provides several admin services for Cloud Datastore.
///
/// Concepts: Project, namespace, kind, and entity as defined in the Google
/// Cloud Datastore API.
///
/// Operation: An Operation represents work being performed in the background.
///
/// EntityFilter: Allows specifying a subset of entities in a project. This is
/// specified as a combination of kinds and namespaces (either or both of which
/// may be all).
///
/// Export/Import Service:
///
/// - The Export/Import service provides the ability to copy all or a subset of
/// entities to/from Google Cloud Storage.
/// - Exported data may be imported into Cloud Datastore for any Google Cloud
/// Platform project. It is not restricted to the export source project. It is
/// possible to export from one project and then import into another.
/// - Exported data can also be loaded into Google BigQuery for analysis.
/// - Exports and imports are performed asynchronously. An Operation resource is
/// created for each export/import. The state (including any errors encountered)
/// of the export/import may be queried via the Operation resource.
///
/// Index Service:
///
/// - The index service manages Cloud Datastore composite indexes.
/// - Index creation and deletion are performed asynchronously.
/// An Operation resource is created for each such asynchronous operation.
/// The state of the operation (including any errors encountered)
/// may be queried via the Operation resource.
///
/// Operation Service:
///
/// - The Operations collection provides a record of actions performed for the
/// specified project (including any operations in progress). Operations are not
/// created directly but through calls on other collections or resources.
/// - An operation that is not yet done may be cancelled. The request to cancel
/// is asynchronous and the operation may continue to run for some time after
/// the request to cancel is made.
/// - An operation that is done may be deleted so that it is no longer listed as
/// part of the Operation collection.
/// - ListOperations returns all pending operations, but not completed
/// operations.
/// - Operations are created by service DatastoreAdmin, but are accessed via
/// service google.longrunning.Operations.
///
/// @par Equality
///
/// Instances of this class created via copy-construction or copy-assignment
/// always compare equal. Instances created with equal
/// `std::shared_ptr<*Connection>` objects compare equal. Objects that compare
/// equal share the same underlying resources.
///
/// @par Performance
///
/// Creating a new instance of this class is a relatively expensive operation,
/// new objects establish new connections to the service. In contrast,
/// copy-construction, move-construction, and the corresponding assignment
/// operations are relatively efficient as the copies share all underlying
/// resources.
///
/// @par Thread Safety
///
/// Concurrent access to different instances of this class, even if they compare
/// equal, is guaranteed to work. Two or more threads operating on the same
/// instance of this class is not guaranteed to work. Since copy-construction
/// and move-construction is a relatively efficient operation, consider using
/// such a copy when using this class from multiple threads.

  ///     details. In brief, this class has `begin()` and `end()` member
  ///     functions returning a iterator class meeting the
  ///     [input iterator requirements]. The value type for this iterator is a
  ///     [`StatusOr`] as the iteration may fail even after some values are
  ///     retrieved successfully, for example, if there is a network disconnect.
  ///     An empty set of results does not indicate an error, it indicates
  ///     that there are no resources meeting the request criteria.
  ///     On a successful iteration the `StatusOr<T>` contains elements of type
  ///     [google.datastore.admin.v1.Index], or rather,
  ///     the C++ class generated by Protobuf from that type. Please consult the
  ///     Protobuf documentation for details on the [Protobuf mapping rules].
