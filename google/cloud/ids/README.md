# Cloud IDS API C++ Client Library

This directory contains an idiomatic C++ client library for the
[Cloud Intrusion Detection System (IDS) API][cloud-service-docs], a
service to detect malware, spyware, command-and-control attacks, and
other network-based threats. Its security efficacy is industry leading,
built with Palo Alto Networks technologies. When you use this product,
your organization name and consumption levels will be shared with Palo
Alto Networks.

While this library is **GA**, please note that the Google Cloud C++ client libraries do **not** follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Supported Platforms

- Windows, macOS, Linux
- C++14 (and higher) compilers (we test with GCC >= 7.3, Clang >= 6.0, and
  MSVC >= 2017)
- Environments with or without exceptions
- Bazel (>= 4.0) and CMake (>= 3.5) builds

## Documentation

- Official documentation about the [Cloud IDS API][cloud-service-docs] service
- [Reference doxygen documentation][doxygen-link] for each release of this
  client library
- Detailed header comments in our [public `.h`][source-link] files

## Quickstart

The [quickstart/](quickstart/README.md) directory contains a minimal environment
to get started using this client library in a larger project. The following
"Hello World" program is used in this quickstart, and should give you a taste of
this library.

<!-- inject-quickstart-start -->

```cc
#include "google/cloud/ids/ids_client.h"
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) try {
  if (argc != 2) {
    std::cerr << "Usage: " << argv[0] << " project-id\n";
    return 1;
  }

  namespace ids = ::google::cloud::ids;
  auto client = ids::IDSClient(ids::MakeIDSConnection());

  auto const parent = std::string{"projects/"} + argv[1] + "/locations/-";
  for (auto ep : client.ListEndpoints(parent)) {
    if (!ep) throw std::runtime_error(ep.status().message());
    std::cout << ep->DebugString() << "\n";
  }

  return 0;
} catch (std::exception const& ex) {
  std::cerr << "Standard exception raised: " << ex.what() << "\n";
  return 1;
}
```

- Packaging maintainers or developers who prefer to install the library in a
  fixed directory (such as `/usr/local` or `/opt`) should consult the
  [packaging guide](/doc/packaging.md).
- Developers that prefer using a package manager such as
  [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io), [Conda](https://conda.io),
  or [Conan](https://conan.io) should follow the instructions for their package
  manager.
- Developers wanting to use the libraries as part of a larger CMake or Bazel
  project should consult the [quickstart guides](#quickstart) for the library
  or libraries they want to use.
- Developers wanting to compile the library just to run some examples or
  tests should read the current document.
- Contributors and developers to `google-cloud-cpp` should consult the guide to
  [set up a development workstation][howto-setup-dev-workstation].
