/**
 * Objects of this class pack single row mutations into bulk mutations.
 *
 * In order to maximize throughput when applying a lot of mutations to Cloud
 * Bigtable, one should pack the mutations in `BulkMutations`. This class helps
 * in doing so. Create a `MutationBatcher` and use
 * `MutationBatcher::AsyncApply()` to apply a large stream of mutations to the
 * same `Table`. Objects of this class will efficiently create batches of
 * `SingleRowMutations` and maintain multiple batches "in flight".
 *
 * This class also offers an easy-to-use flow control mechanism to avoid
 * unbounded growth in its internal buffers.
 *
 * Applications must provide a `CompletionQueue` to (asynchronously) execute
 * these operations. The application is responsible of executing the
 * `CompletionQueue` event loop in one or more threads.
 *
 * @par Thread-safety
 * Instances of this class are guaranteed to work when accessed concurrently
 * from multiple threads.

   * The mutation will most likely be batched together with others to optimize

   *
   * @param mut the mutation. Note that this function takes ownership
   *    (and then discards) the data in the mutation.  In general, a
   *    `SingleRowMutation` can be used to modify and/or delete
   *    multiple cells, across different columns and column families.
   * @param cq the completion queue that will execute the asynchronous
   *    calls, the application must ensure that one or more threads are
   *    blocked on `cq.Run()`.
   *
   * @return *admission* and *completion* futures
   *
   * The *completion* future will report the mutation's status once it
   * completes.
   *
   * The *admission* future should be used for flow control. In order to bound
   * the memory usage used by `MutationBatcher`, one should not submit more
   * mutations before the *admission* future is satisfied. Note that while the
   * future is often already satisfied when the function returns, applications
   * should not assume that this is always the case.
   *
   * One should not make assumptions on which future will be satisfied first.

   * std::thread cq_runner([]() { cq.Run(); });

   *   completion_future.then([](future<Status> completion_status) {
   *       // handle mutation completion asynchronously
   *       });
   *   // Potentially slow down submission not to make buffers in
   *   // MutationBatcher grow unbounded.
   *   admission_future.get();
   * }
