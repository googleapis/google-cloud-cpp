GOOGLE_CLOUD_CPP_INLINE_NAMESPACE_BEGIN
/**
 * Implements the APIs to administer Cloud Bigtable instances.
 *
 * @par Thread-safety
 * Instances of this class created via copy-construction or copy-assignment
 * share the underlying pool of connections. Access to these copies via multiple
 * threads is guaranteed to work. Two threads operating concurrently on the same
 * instance of this class is not guaranteed to work.
 *
 * @par Cost
 * Creating a new object of type `InstanceAdmin` is comparable to creating a few
 * objects of type `std::string` or a few objects of type
 * `std::shared_ptr<int>`. The class represents a shallow handle to a remote
 * object.
 *
 * @par Error Handling
 * This class uses `StatusOr<T>` to report errors. When an operation fails to
 * perform its work the returned `StatusOr<T>` contains the error details. If
 * the `ok()` member function in the `StatusOr<T>` returns `true` then it
 * contains the expected result. Operations that do not return a value simply
 * return a `google::cloud::Status` indicating success or the details of the
 * error Please consult the [`StatusOr<T>`
 * documentation](#google::cloud::StatusOr) for more details.
 *
 * @code
 * namespace cbt = google::cloud::bigtable;
 * namespace btadmin = google::bigtable::admin::v2;
 * cbt::TableAdmin admin = ...;
 * google::cloud::StatusOr<btadmin::Table> metadata = admin.GetTable(...);
 *
 * if (!metadata) {
 *   std::cerr << "Error fetching table metadata\n";
 *   return;
 * }
 *
 * // Use "metadata" as a smart pointer here, e.g.:
 * std::cout << "The full table name is " << table->name() << " the table has "
 *           << table->column_families_size() << " column families\n";
 * @endcode
 *
 * In addition, the @ref index "main page" contains examples using `StatusOr<T>`
 * to handle errors.
 *
 * @par Retry, Backoff, and Idempotency Policies
 * The library automatically retries requests that fail with transient errors,
 * and uses [truncated exponential backoff][backoff-link] to backoff between
 * retries. The default policies are to continue retrying for up to 10 minutes.
 * On each transient failure the backoff period is doubled, starting with an
 * initial backoff of 100 milliseconds. The backoff period growth is truncated
 * at 60 seconds. The default idempotency policy is to only retry idempotent
 * operations. Note that most operations that change state are **not**
 * idempotent.
 *
 * The application can override these policies when constructing objects of this
 * class. The documentation for the constructors show examples of this in
 * action.
 *
 * [backoff-link]: https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/exponential-backoff

   *     - `RPCBackoffPolicy` how to backoff from a failed RPC. Currently only
   *       `ExponentialBackoffPolicy` is implemented. You can also create your
   *       own policies that backoff using a different algorithm.
   *     - `RPCRetryPolicy` for how long to retry failed RPCs. Use
   *       `LimitedErrorCountRetryPolicy` to limit the number of failures
   *       allowed. Use `LimitedTimeRetryPolicy` to bound the time for any
   *       request. You can also create your own policies that combine time and
   *       error counts.
   *     - `PollingPolicy` for how long will the class wait for
   *       `google.longrunning.Operation` to complete. This class combines both
   *       the backoff policy for checking long running operations and the
   *       retry policy.
