@page bigtable-samples-data-client Example: Advanced Reading and Writing Samples

This example is for advanced reading and writing opertions on bigtable data client, that illustrates how to:

- Use ReadModifyWrite to append a string to a value.
- Use ReadModifyWrite to increment a value.
- Use the features to simplify reading big-endian values from Cloud Bigtable.
- Use CheckAndMutate to modify a value only if it exists.

## Run the example

This example uses the [Cloud Bigtable C++ Client Library][reference-link]
to communicate with Cloud Bigtable.

To run the example program, follow the [instructions][github-examples] for the
example on GitHub.

[github-examples]: https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-cpp/tree/main/google/cloud/bigtable/examples/

### Include the Necessary Headers

The example uses the following headers:

@snippet data_snippets.cc bigtable includes

### Connect to the Cloud Bigtable data client endpoint.

@snippet data_snippets.cc connect data

### Use ReadModifyWrite to increament a value and append a string to a value.

@snippet data_snippets.cc read modify write

### Use the features to simplify reading big-endian values from Cloud Bigtable.

@snippet read_snippets.cc read row

### Use CheckAndMutate to modify a cell if it has a value.

@snippet data_snippets.cc check and mutate

### Use CheckAndMutate to modify a cell if another cell exists.

@snippet data_snippets.cc check and mutate not present
