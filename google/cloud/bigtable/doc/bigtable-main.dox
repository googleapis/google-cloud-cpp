@mainpage Google Cloud Platform Bigtable C++ Client Library

# Overview

Cloud Bigtable is Google's NoSQL Big Data database service. It's the same
database that powers many core Google services, including Search, Analytics,
Maps, and Gmail.

The Cloud Bigtable C++ Client library offers types and functions
to access Cloud Bigtable from C++ applications
([Read more about Cloud Bigtable][read-more-about-gcp-bigtable]).
It offers access to the Cloud Bigtable API, including operations to list, read,
write, and delete [Instances and Clusters][read-instances-clusters],
[Tables][read-tables] and [Application Profiles][read-app-profiles].

## Quickstart

The following instructions show you how to perform basic tasks in Cloud Bigtable
using the C++ client library.

### Before you begin

1. Select or create a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project using the
   [manage resource page][resource-link]. Make a note of the project id, you
   will need to use it later.
2. Make sure that [billing is enabled][billing-link] for your project.
3. Learn about [key terms and concepts][concepts-link] for Cloud Bigtable.
4. Setup the authentication for the examples:
   - [Configure a service account][authentication-quickstart],
   - or [login with your personal account][gcloud-quickstart]

## Setting up your repo

In order to use the Cloud Bigtable C++ client library from your own code, you'll
need to configure your build system how to fetch and compile the Cloud C++
client library. The Cloud C++ client library natively supports the
[Bazel](https://bazel.build/) and [CMake](https://cmake.org/) build systems.
We've created a minimal, "Hello world", [quickstart repo][cbt-quickstart] that
includes detailed instructions on how to compile the library for use in your
application. You can fetch the source from [GitHub][github-link] as normal:

@code{.sh}
git clone https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-cpp.git
cd google-cloud-cpp/google/cloud/bigtable/quickstart
@endcode

@par Example: Quickstart

The following shows the code that you'll run in the
`google/cloud/bigtable/quickstart/` directory,
which should give you a taste of the Cloud Bigtable C++ client library API.

@include quickstart.cc

## API Notes

- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=...` is used in examples and integration tests to
  configure the GCP project.

- `BIGTABLE_EMULATOR_HOST=host:port` tells the library to connect to the
  specified emulator rather than the default endpoint.

- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_CPP_ENABLE_TRACING=rpc` turns on tracing for most gRPC
  calls, the library injects an additional Stub decorator that prints each gRPC
  request and response. Unless you have configured you own logging backend, you
  should also set `GOOGLE_CLOUD_CPP_ENABLE_CLOG` to produce any output on the
  program's console.

- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_CPP_TRACING_OPTIONS=...` modifies the behavior of gRPC tracing,
  including whether messages will be output on multiple lines, or whether
  string/bytes fields will be truncated.

- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_CPP_ENABLE_CLOG=yes` turns on logging in the library, basically
  the library always "logs" but the logging infrastructure has no backend to
  actually print anything until the application sets a backend or they set this
  environment variable.

## Override the default endpoint

In some cases, you may need to override the default endpoint used by the client
library. Use the `google::cloud::EndpointOption` when initializing the client
library to change this default.  For example, this will override the default
endpoint for `google::cloud::bigtable::Table`:

@snippet client_samples.cc table-set-endpoint

Follow these links for additional examples
 [BigtableTableAdminClient](@ref BigtableTableAdminClient-set-endpoint-snippet)
 [InstanceTableAdminClient](@ref BigtableInstanceAdminClient-set-endpoint-snippet)

## Override the authentication configuration

Some applications cannot use the default authentication mechanism (known as
[Application Default Credentials]). You can override this default using
`google::cloud::UnifiedCredentialsOption`. The following example shows how
to explicitly load a service account key file.

@snippet client_samples.cc table-with-service-account

Keep in mind that we chose this as an example because it is relatively easy to
understand. Consult the [Best practices for managing service account keys]
guide for more details.
