/**
 * The main interface to interact with data in a Cloud Bigtable table.
 *
 * This class provides member functions to:
 * - read specific rows: `Table::ReadRow()`
 * - scan a ranges of rows: `Table::ReadRows()`
 * - update or create a single row: `Table::Apply()`
 * - update or modify multiple rows: `Table::BulkApply()`
 * - update a row based on previous values: `Table::CheckAndMutateRow()`
 * - to atomically append data and/or increment multiple values in a row:
 *   `Table::ReadModifyWriteRow()`
 * - to sample the row keys: `Table::SampleRows()`.
 *
 * The class deals with the most common transient failures, and retries the
 * underlying RPC calls subject to the policies configured by the application.
 * These policies are documented in `Table::Table()`.
 *
 * @par Thread-safety
 * Instances of this class created via copy-construction or copy-assignment
 * share the underlying pool of connections. Access to these copies via multiple
 * threads is guaranteed to work. Two threads operating concurrently on the same
 * instance of this class is not guaranteed to work.
 *
 * @par Cost
 * Creating a new object of type `Table` is comparable to creating a few objects
 * of type `std::string` or a few objects of type `std::shared_ptr<int>`. The
 * class represents a shallow handle to a remote object.
 *
 * @par Error Handling
 * This class uses `StatusOr<T>` to report errors. When an operation fails to
 * perform its work the returned `StatusOr<T>` contains the error details. If
 * the `ok()` member function in the `StatusOr<T>` returns `true` then it
 * contains the expected result. Operations that do not return a value simply
 * return a `google::cloud::Status` indicating success or the details of the
 * error Please consult the [`StatusOr<T>`
 * documentation](#google::cloud::StatusOr) for more details.
 *
 * @code
 * namespace cbt = google::cloud::bigtable;
 * cbt::Table = ...;
 * google::cloud::StatusOr<std::pair<bool, cbt::Row>> row = table.ReadRow(...);
 *
 * if (!row) {
 *   std::cerr << "Error reading row\n";
 *   return;
 * }
 *
 * // Use "row" as a smart pointer here, e.g.:
 * if (!row->first) {
 *   std::cout << "Contacting the server was successful, but the row does not"
 *             << " exist\n";
 *   return;
 * }
 * std::cout << "The row has " << row->second.cells().size() << " cells\n";
 * @endcode
 *
 * In addition, the @ref index "main page" contains examples using `StatusOr<T>`
 * to handle errors.
 *
 * @par Retry, Backoff, and Idempotency Policies
 * The library automatically retries requests that fail with transient errors,
 * and uses [truncated exponential backoff][backoff-link] to backoff between
 * retries. The default policies are to continue retrying for up to 10 minutes.
 * On each transient failure the backoff period is doubled, starting with an
 * initial backoff of 100 milliseconds. The backoff period growth is truncated
 * at 60 seconds. The default idempotency policy is to only retry idempotent
 * operations. Note that most operations that change state are **not**
 * idempotent.
 *
 * The application can override these policies when constructing objects of this
 * class. The documentation for the constructors show examples of this in
 * action.
