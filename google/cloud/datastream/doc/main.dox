@mainpage Datastream API C++ Client Library

An idiomatic C++ client library for the [Datastream API][cloud-service-docs],
a serverless and easy-to-use change data capture (CDC) and replication service.
It allows you to synchronize data across heterogeneous databases and
applications reliably, and with minimal latency and downtime.

While this library is **GA**, please note that the Google Cloud C++ client libraries do **not** follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Quickstart

The following shows the code that you'll run in the
`google/cloud/datastream/quickstart/` directory,
which should give you a taste of the Datastream API C++ client library API.

## Main classes

<!-- inject-client-list-start -->
The main class in this library is
[`datastream_v1::DatastreamClient`](@ref google::cloud::datastream_v1::DatastreamClient). All RPCs are exposed
as member functions of this class. Other classes provide helpers, configuration
parameters, and infrastructure to mock
[`datastream_v1::DatastreamClient`](@ref google::cloud::datastream_v1::DatastreamClient) when testing your
application.
<!-- inject-client-list-end -->
