# Common Types and Functions for the Google Cloud C++ Libraries

The source files in `google/cloud/` define types and functions shared by the
several Google Cloud C++ libraries. Here is where you will find the
implementation of types used throughout the libraries, such as
`StatusOr<T>`, `Status`, `future<T>`, or `CompletionQueue`.

We consider this code stable and generally available. Please note that the
Google Cloud C++ client libraries do **not** follow
[Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

Some sub-directories include **internal-only** types and functions. These are
used in the implementation of the Google Cloud C++ libraries, but are **not**
intended for general use. They are subject to change and/or removal without
notice. These include `google/cloud/internal/`, and
`google-cloud/testing_utils/`.
