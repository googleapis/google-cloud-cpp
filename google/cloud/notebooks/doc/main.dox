@mainpage Notebooks API C++ Client Library

An idiomatic C++ client library for the [Notebooks API][cloud-service-docs].
Use this API to programmatically manage notebooks in Google Cloud. Learn
more about notebooks at the [Vertex AI Workbench] site.

While this library is **GA**, please note Google Cloud C++ client libraries do **not** follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Quickstart

The following shows the code that you'll run in the
`google/cloud/notebooks/quickstart/` directory,
which should give you a taste of the Notebooks API C++ client library API.

## Main classes

<!-- inject-client-list-start -->
This library offers multiple `*Client` classes, which are listed below. Each
one of these classes exposes all the RPCs for a gRPC `service` as member
functions of the class. This library groups multiple gRPC services because they
are part of the same product or are often used together. A typical example may
be the administrative and data plane operations for a single product.

The library also has other classes that provide helpers, configuration
parameters, and infrastructure to mock the `*Client` classes when testing your
application.

- [\c notebooks_v1::ManagedNotebookServiceClient](@ref google::cloud::notebooks_v1::ManagedNotebookServiceClient)
- [\c notebooks_v1::NotebookServiceClient](@ref google::cloud::notebooks_v1::NotebookServiceClient)
<!-- inject-client-list-end -->
