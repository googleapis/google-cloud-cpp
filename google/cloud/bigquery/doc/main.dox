@mainpage Cloud BigQuery C++ Client Library

The Cloud BigQuery C++ Client library offers types and functions to use Cloud
BigQuery from C++11 applications.

This library requires a C++14 compiler. It is supported (and tested) on multiple
Linux distributions, macOS, and Windows.

@tableofcontents{HTML:2}

## Quickstart

The following instructions show you how to perform basic tasks in Cloud BigQuery
using the C++ client library.

### Before you begin

1. Select or create a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project using the
   [manage resource page][resource-link]. Make a note of the project id as you
   will need to use it later.
2. Make sure that [billing is enabled][billing-link] for your project.
3. Learn about [key terms and concepts][concepts-link] for Cloud BigQuery.
4. Setup the authentication for the examples:
   - [Configure a service account][gcloud-authorizing],
   - or [login with your personal account][gcloud-authorizing]

## Setting up your repo

In order to use the Cloud BigQuery C++ client library from your own code, you'll
need to configure your build system to fetch and compile the Cloud C++
client library. The Cloud BigQuery C++ client library natively supports the
[Bazel](https://bazel.build/) and [CMake](https://cmake.org/) build systems.
We've created a minimal, "Hello world", [quickstart repo][quickstart-link] that
includes detailed instructions on how to compile the library for use in your
application. You can fetch the source from [GitHub][github-link] as normal:

@code{.sh}
git clone https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-cpp.git
cd google-cloud-cpp/google/cloud/bigquery/quickstart
@endcode

@par Example: Hello World
@parblock
The following shows the code that you'll run in the
`google/cloud/bigquery/quickstart/` directory, which should give you a taste of
the Cloud BigQuery C++ client library API.

@include quickstart.cc
@endparblock

## Environment Variables

There are several environment variables that can be set to configure certain
behaviors in the library.

<!-- inject-endpoint-env-vars-start -->

- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_CPP_ANALYTICS_HUB_SERVICE_ENDPOINT=...` overrides the
  `EndpointOption` (which defaults to "analyticshub.googleapis.com")
  used by `MakeAnalyticsHubServiceConnection()`.

- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_CPP_BIGQUERY_READ_ENDPOINT=...` overrides the
  `EndpointOption` (which defaults to "bigquerystorage.googleapis.com")
  used by `MakeBigQueryReadConnection()`.

- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_CPP_BIGQUERY_WRITE_ENDPOINT=...` overrides the
  `EndpointOption` (which defaults to "bigquerystorage.googleapis.com")
  used by `MakeBigQueryWriteConnection()`.

- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_CPP_BIGQUERY_CONNECTION_SERVICE_ENDPOINT=...` overrides the
  `EndpointOption` (which defaults to "bigqueryconnection.googleapis.com")
  used by `MakeConnection()`.

- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_CPP_DATA_TRANSFER_SERVICE_ENDPOINT=...` overrides the
  `EndpointOption` (which defaults to "bigquerydatatransfer.googleapis.com")
  used by `MakeDataTransferServiceConnection()`.

- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_CPP_MIGRATION_SERVICE_ENDPOINT=...` overrides the
  `EndpointOption` (which defaults to "bigquerymigration.googleapis.com")
  used by `MakeMigrationServiceConnection()`.

- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_CPP_MODEL_SERVICE_ENDPOINT=...` overrides the
  `EndpointOption` (which defaults to "bigquery.googleapis.com")
  used by `MakeModelServiceConnection()`.

- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_CPP_RESERVATION_SERVICE_ENDPOINT=...` overrides the
  `EndpointOption` (which defaults to "bigqueryreservation.googleapis.com")
  used by `MakeReservationServiceConnection()`.

<!-- inject-endpoint-env-vars-end -->

- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_CPP_ENABLE_TRACING=rpc` turns on tracing for most gRPC
  calls. The library injects an additional Stub decorator that prints each gRPC
  request and response.  Unless you have configured you own logging backend,
  you should also set `GOOGLE_CLOUD_CPP_ENABLE_CLOG` to produce any output on
  the program's console.

- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_CPP_TRACING_OPTIONS=...` modifies the behavior of gRPC tracing,
  including whether messages will be output on multiple lines, or whether
  string/bytes fields will be truncated.

- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=...` is used in examples and integration tests to
  configure the GCP project.

- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_CPP_ENABLE_CLOG=yes` turns on logging in the library, basically
  the library always "logs" but the logging infrastructure has no backend to
  actually print anything until the application sets a backend or they set this
  environment variable.

## Error Handling

This library never throws exceptions to signal errors. In general, the library
returns a [`StatusOr<T>`][status-or-header] if an error is possible. Some
functions return objects that are not wrapped in a `StatusOr<>` but will
themselves return a `StatusOr<T>` to signal an error. For example, wrappers for
asynchronous operations return `future<StatusOr<T>>`.

Applications should check if the `StatusOr<T>` contains a value before using
it, much like how you might check that a pointer is not null before
dereferencing it. Indeed, a `StatusOr<T>` object can be used like a
smart-pointer to `T`, with the main difference being that when it does not hold
a `T` it will instead hold a `Status` object with extra information about the
error.

You can check that a `StatusOr<T>` contains a value by calling the `.ok()`
method, or by using `operator bool()` (like with other smart pointers). If
there is no value, you can access the contained `Status` object using the
`.status()` member. If there is a value, you may access it by dereferencing
with `operator*()` or `operator->()`. As with all smart pointers, callers must
first check that the `StatusOr<T>` contains a value before dereferencing and
accessing the contained value. Alternatively, callers may instead use the
`.value()` member function which is defined to throw a `RuntimeStatusError` if
there is no value.

@note If you're compiling with exceptions disabled, calling `.value()` on a
    `StatusOr<T>` that does not contain a value will terminate the program
    instead of throwing.

## Override the default endpoint

In some cases, you may need to override the default endpoint used by the client
library. Use the `google::cloud::EndpointOption` when initializing the client
library to change this default.
