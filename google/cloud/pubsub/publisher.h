/**
 * Publish messages to the Cloud Pub/Sub service.
 *
 * This class is used to publish message to a given topic, with a fixed
 * configuration such as credentials, batching, background threads, etc.
 * Applications that publish messages to multiple topics need to create separate
 * instances of this class. Applications wanting to publish events with
 * different batching configuration also need to create separate instances.
 *
 * @see https://cloud.google.com/pubsub for an overview of the Cloud Pub/Sub
 *   service.
 *
 * @par Example
 * @snippet samples.cc publish
 *
 * @par Message Ordering
 * A `Publisher` configured to preserve message ordering will sequence the
 * messages that share a common ordering key (see
 * `MessageBuilder::SetOrderingKey()`). Messages will be batched by ordering
 * key, and new batches will wait until the status of the previous batch is
 * known. On an error, all pending and queued messages are discarded, and the
 * publisher rejects any new messages for the ordering key that experienced
 * problems. The application must call `Publisher::ResumePublishing()` to
 * to restore publishing.
 *
 * @par Performance
 * `Publisher` objects are relatively cheap to create, copy, and move. However,
 * each `Publisher` object must be created with a
 * `std::shared_ptr<PublisherConnection>`, which itself is relatively expensive
 * to create. Therefore, connection instances should be shared when possible.
 * See the `MakePublisherConnection()` method and the `PublisherConnection`
 * interface for more details.
 *
 * @par Thread Safety
 * Instances of this class created via copy-construction or copy-assignment
 * share the underlying pool of connections. Access to these copies via multiple
 * threads is guaranteed to work. Two threads operating on the same instance of
 * this class is not guaranteed to work.
 *
 * @par Background Threads
 * This class uses the background threads configured via the `Options` from
 * `GrpcOptionList`. Applications can create their own pool of background
 * threads by (a) creating their own #google::cloud::CompletionQueue, (b)
 * passing this completion queue as a `GrpcCompletionQueueOption`, and (c)
 * attaching any number of threads to the completion queue.
 *
 * @par Example: using a custom thread pool
 * @snippet samples.cc custom-thread-pool-publisher
 *
 * @par Asynchronous Functions
 * Some of the member functions in this class return a `future<T>` (or
 * `future<StatusOr<T>>`) object.  Readers are probably familiar with
 * [`std::future<T>`][std-future-link]. Our version adds a `.then()` function to
 * attach a callback to the future, which is invoked when the future is
 * satisfied. This function returns a `future<U>` where `U` is the return value
 * of the attached function. More details in the #google::cloud::future
 * documentation.
 *
 * @par Error Handling
 * This class uses `StatusOr<T>` to report errors. When an operation fails to
 * perform its work the returned `StatusOr<T>` contains the error details. If
 * the `ok()` member function in the `StatusOr<T>` returns `true` then it
 * contains the expected result. Please consult the #google::cloud::StatusOr
 * documentation for more details.
 *
 * @par Batching Configuration Example
 * @snippet samples.cc publisher-options
 *
 * [std-future-link]: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/future

  /**
   * Publishes a message to this publisher's topic
   *
   * Note that the message may be batched, depending on the Publisher's
   * configuration. It could be delayed until the batch has enough messages,
   * or enough data, or enough time has elapsed. See the `PublisherOptionList`
   * documentation for more details.
   *
   * @par Idempotency
   * This is a non-idempotent operation, but the client library will
   * automatically retry RPCs that fail with transient errors. As Cloud Pub/Sub
   * has "at least once" delivery semantics applications are expected to handle
   * duplicate messages without problems. The application can disable retries
   * by changing the retry policy, please see the example below.
   *
   * @par Example
   * @snippet samples.cc publish
   *
   * @par Disabling Retries Example
   * @snippet samples.cc publisher-disable-retries
   *
   * @par Changing Retry Parameters Example
   * @snippet samples.cc publisher-retry-settings
   *
   * @return a future that becomes satisfied when the message is published or on
   *     a unrecoverable error.
