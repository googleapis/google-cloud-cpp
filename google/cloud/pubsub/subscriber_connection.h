 * forward to the one pure-virtual function declared in this interface. This
 * allows users to inject custom behavior (e.g., with a Google Mock object) in a
 * `Subscriber` object for use in their own tests.
 *
 * To create a concrete instance that connects you to the real Cloud Pub/Sub
 * service, see `MakeSubscriberConnection()`.

 * Applications may define classes derived from `SubscriberConnection`, for
 * example, because they want to mock the class. To avoid breaking all such
 * derived classes when we change the number or type of the arguments to the
 * member functions we define lightweight structures to pass the arguments.
