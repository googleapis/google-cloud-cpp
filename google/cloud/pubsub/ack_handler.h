/**
 * Defines the interface to acknowledge and reject messages.
 *
 * When applications register a callback to receive Pub/Sub messages the
 * callback must be able to receive both a `pubsub::Message` and its associated
 * `pubsub::AckHandler`. Actions on a `pubsub::AckHandler` always affect the
 * same message received in the callback. Applications cannot create standalone
 * handlers (except in unit tests via mocks).
 *
 * This interface allows applications to acknowledge and reject messages in a
 * provided to the Cloud Pub/Sub C++ client library. Note that this class is
 * move-able, to support applications that process messages asynchronously.
 * However, this class is *not* copy-able, because messages can only be
 * acknowledged or rejected exactly once.
 *
 * @par Thread Safety
 * This class is *thread compatible*, only one thread should call non-const
 * member functions of this class at a time. Note that because the non-const
 * member functions are `&&` overloads the application can only call `ack()` or
 * `nack()` exactly once, and only one of them.
