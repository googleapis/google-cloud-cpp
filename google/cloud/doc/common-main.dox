@mainpage Common Components for the Google Cloud C++ Client Libraries

# Overview

This library contains common components shared by all the Google Cloud C++
Client Libraries. Including:

- [Status](@ref google::cloud::omit_this_inline_ns::Status) error codes and details from an
  operation.
- [StatusOr<T>](@ref google::cloud::omit_this_inline_ns::StatusOr) returns a value on success
  and a `Status` on error.
- [future<T>](@ref google::cloud::omit_this_inline_ns::future) and
  [promise<T>](@ref google::cloud::omit_this_inline_ns::promise) futures (a holder that will
  receive a value asynchronously) and promises (the counterpart of a future,
  where values are stored asynchronously). They satisfy the API for
  `std::future` and `std::promise`, and add support for callbacks and
  cancellation.
