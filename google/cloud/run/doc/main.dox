@mainpage Cloud Run Admin API C++ Client Library

This directory contains an idiomatic C++ client library for
[Cloud Run][cloud-service-docs], a managed compute platform that lets
you run containers directly on top of Google's scalable infrastructure.

Note that this library only provides tools to **manage** Cloud Run resources. To
actually deploy a C++ function to Cloud Run, see the
[Cloud Run for C++ Hello World][hello-world] example, which uses the
[C++ Functions Framework][functions-framework] library.

[hello-world]: https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cpp-samples/tree/main/cloud-run-hello-world
[functions-framework]: https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/functions-framework-cpp

While this library is **GA**, please note Google Cloud C++ client libraries do **not** follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

This library requires a C++14 compiler. It is supported (and tested) on multiple
Linux distributions, as well as Windows and macOS. The [README][github-readme]
on [GitHub][github-link] provides detailed instructions to install the necessary
dependencies, as well as how to compile the client library.

## Setting up your repo

In order to use the Cloud Run Admin API C++ client library from your own code,
you'll need to configure your build system to discover and compile the Cloud
C++ client libraries. In some cases your build system or package manager may
need to download the libraries too. The Cloud C++ client libraries natively
support [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) and [CMake](https://cmake.org/) as build
systems. We've created a minimal, "Hello World", [quickstart][github-quickstart]
that includes detailed instructions on how to compile the library for use in
your application. You can fetch the source from [GitHub][github-link] as normal:

@code{.sh}
git clone https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-cpp.git
cd google-cloud-cpp/google/cloud/run/quickstart
@endcode

@par Example: Quickstart

The following shows the code that you'll run in the
`google/cloud/run/quickstart/` directory,
which should give you a taste of the Cloud Run Admin API C++ client library API.

## Error Handling

[status-or-header]: https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-cpp/blob/main/google/cloud/status_or.h

This library never throws exceptions to signal error, but you can use exceptions
to detect errors in the returned objects. In general, the library returns a
[`StatusOr<T>`][status-or-header] if an error is possible. This is an "outcome"
type, when the operation is successful a `StatusOr<T>` converts to `true` in
boolean context (and its `.ok()` member function returns `true`), the
application can then use `operator->` or `operator*` to access the `T` value.
When the operation fails a `StatusOr<T>` converts to `false` (and `.ok()`
returns `false`). It is undefined behavior to use the value in this case.

If you prefer to use exceptions on error, you can use the `.value()` accessor.
It will return the `T` value or throw on error.

For operations that do not return a value the library simply returns
`google::cloud::Status`.

## Override the default endpoint

In some cases, you may need to override the default endpoint used by the client
library. Use the `google::cloud::EndpointOption` when initializing the client
library to change this default.

<!-- inject-endpoint-snippet-start -->
For example, this will override the default endpoint for `run_v2::RevisionsClient`:

@snippet revisions_client_samples.cc set-client-endpoint

Follow these links to find examples for other \c *Client classes:
 [run_v2::RevisionsClient](@ref run_v2::RevisionsClient-endpoint-snippet)
 [run_v2::ServicesClient](@ref run_v2::ServicesClient-endpoint-snippet)

<!-- inject-endpoint-snippet-end -->

## Override the authentication configuration

Some applications cannot use the default authentication mechanism (known as
[Application Default Credentials]). You can override this default using
`google::cloud::UnifiedCredentialsOption`. The following example shows how
to explicitly load a service account key file.

<!-- inject-service-account-snippet-start -->
@snippet revisions_client_samples.cc with-service-account

Follow these links to find examples for other \c *Client classes:
 [run_v2::RevisionsClient](@ref run_v2::RevisionsClient-service-account-snippet)
 [run_v2::ServicesClient](@ref run_v2::ServicesClient-service-account-snippet)

<!-- inject-service-account-snippet-end -->

Keep in mind that we chose this as an example because it is relatively easy to
understand. Consult the [Best practices for managing service account keys]
guide for more details.

@see @ref guac - for more information on the factory functions to create
`google::cloud::Credentials` objects.

## Retry, Backoff, and Idempotency Policies.

The library automatically retries requests that fail with transient errors, and
uses [exponential backoff] to backoff between retries. Application developers
can override the default policies.
