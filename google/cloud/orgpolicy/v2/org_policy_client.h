///
/// An interface for managing organization policies.
///
/// The Cloud Org Policy service provides a simple mechanism for organizations
/// to restrict the allowed configurations across their entire Cloud Resource
/// hierarchy.
///
/// You can use a `policy` to configure restrictions in Cloud resources. For
/// example, you can enforce a `policy` that restricts which Google
/// Cloud Platform APIs can be activated in a certain part of your resource
/// hierarchy, or prevents serial port access to VM instances in a particular
/// folder.
///
/// `Policies` are inherited down through the resource hierarchy. A `policy`
/// applied to a parent resource automatically applies to all its child
/// resources unless overridden with a `policy` lower in the hierarchy.
///
/// A `constraint` defines an aspect of a resource's configuration that can be
/// controlled by an organization's policy administrator. `Policies` are a
/// collection of `constraints` that defines their allowable configuration on a
/// particular resource and its child resources.
///
/// @par Equality
///
/// Instances of this class created via copy-construction or copy-assignment
/// always compare equal. Instances created with equal
/// `std::shared_ptr<*Connection>` objects compare equal. Objects that compare
/// equal share the same underlying resources.
///
/// @par Performance
///
/// Creating a new instance of this class is a relatively expensive operation,
/// new objects establish new connections to the service. In contrast,
/// copy-construction, move-construction, and the corresponding assignment
/// operations are relatively efficient as the copies share all underlying
/// resources.
///
/// @par Thread Safety
///
/// Concurrent access to different instances of this class, even if they compare
/// equal, is guaranteed to work. Two or more threads operating on the same
/// instance of this class is not guaranteed to work. Since copy-construction
/// and move-construction is a relatively efficient operation, consider using
/// such a copy when using this class from multiple threads.
///
