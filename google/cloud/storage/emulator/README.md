# A Google Cloud Storage Emulator

This is an emulator for the Google Cloud Storage (GCS) JSON API (both over
REST and gRPC), and a limited support for the XML API. While it emulates most of
the behaviors of GCS, it was developed mostly as an emulator for the client
library. The emulator, for example, performs far fewer error checks and no permission
checks (ACL/IAM). Generally, the error codes are similar to the ones generated by
GCS, but the error messages are not. In short, this is intended for testing, and
not as a general purpose emulator.

## Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run Tests

Tests use https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html and can be ran using:

```bash
python -m unittest tests/test_*.py
```

## Run Test Bench

### Emulator

```bash
cd google-cloud-cpp
# To make sure `Keep-Alive` header works, `--threads` should not be smaller than 2.
gunicorn --bind "localhost:9000" --worker-class sync --threads 10 --access-logfile - --chdir google/cloud/storage/emulator "emulator:run()"
# if you want to use gRPC API, run the following command.
curl "http://localhost:9000/start_grpc?port=8000"
# gRPC server will start listening at port 8000.
```

### Client

For `google-cloud-cpp`, please set the following environment variable

```bash
CLOUD_STORAGE_EMULATOR_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9000 # For JSON and XML API
CLOUD_STORAGE_GRPC_ENDPOINT=localhost:8000 # For gRPC API
```

## Force Failures

You can force the following failures by using the `x-goog-emulator-instructions` header.
The `x-goog-testbench-instructions` header is deprecated, but supported for
backwards compatibility and provides the same functionality as
`x-goog-emulator-instructions`, please change your code to use `x-goog-emulator-instructions` instead.

### return-broken-stream

Set request headers with `x-goog-emulator-instructions: return-broken-stream`.
Emulator will fail after sending 1024*1024 bytes.

### return-corrupted-data

Set request headers with `x-goog-emulator-instructions: return-corrupted-data`.
Emulator will return corrupted data.

### stall-always

Set request headers with `x-goog-emulator-instructions: stall-always`.
Emulator will stall at the beginning.

### stall-at-256KiB

Set request headers with `x-goog-emulator-instructions: stall-at-256KiB`.
Emulator will stall at 256KiB bytes.

### return-503-after-256K

Set request headers with `x-goog-emulator-instructions: return-503-after-256K`.
Emulator will return a `HTTP 503` after sending 256KiB bytes.

### return-503-after-256K/retry-N

Set request headers with `x-goog-emulator-instructions: return-503-after-256K/retry-1` up to `x-goog-emulator-instructions: return-503-after-256K/retry-N`.

For N==1 and N==2 behave like `return-305-after-256K`, for `N>=3` ignore the
failure instruction and return successfully. This is used to test failures during
retry, the client cooperates by sending the retry counter in the failure
instructions.


## Retry Test API

The "Retry Test API" offers a mechanism to describe more complex retry scenarios
while sending a single, constant header through all the HTTP requests from a
test program. Retry Test provides accounting of failures used to validate
the expected failures were experienced by the emulator and not accidentally missed.

Previous versions of the GCS emulator used a custom header in the RPC to
control the behavior of each RPC, for some test scenarios this required sending
different header with the first retry attempt vs. subsequent attempts. Producing
different headers in each attempt is not easy to implement with some client libraries.

Sending a constant header with all RPCs can be implemented across all client libraries,
and to some degree decouples the test setup from the test execution.

### Creating a new Retry Test

The following cURL request will create a Retry Test resource which emits a 503
when a buckets list operation is received by the emulator with the returned
retry test ID.

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:9000/retry_test" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"instructions":{"storage.buckets.list": ["return-503"]}}'
```

### Get a Retry Test resource

Get Retry Test resource by id "1d05c20627844214a9ff7cbcf696317d".

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9000/retry_test/1d05c20627844214a9ff7cbcf696317d"
```

### Delete a Retry Test resource

Delete Retry Test resource by id "1d05c20627844214a9ff7cbcf696317d".

```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:9000/retry_test/1d05c20627844214a9ff7cbcf696317d"
```

### Causing a failure using x-retry-test-id header

The following cURL request will attempt to list buckets and the emulator will emit
a `503` error once based on the Retry Test created above. Subsequent list buckets
operations will succeed.

```bash
curl -H "x-retry-test-id: 1d05c20627844214a9ff7cbcf696317d" "http://localhost:9100/storage/v1/b?project=test"
```

### Forced Failures Supported

| Failure Id              | Description
| ----------------------- | ---
| return-X                | Emulator will fail with HTTP code provided for `X`, e.g. return-503 returns a 503
| return-X-after-YK       | Not Supported. Return X after YKiB of uploaded data
| return-broken-stream    | Emulator will fail after sending 10 bytes
| return-reset-connection | Emulator will fail with a reset connection
