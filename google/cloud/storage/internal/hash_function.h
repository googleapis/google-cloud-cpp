/**
 * Defines the interface to compute hash values during uploads and downloads.
 *
 * To verify data integrity GCS offers both MD5 and CRC32C hashes (though the
 * latter are referred to as "checksums"). The library needs to compute these
 * hashes to:
 * - Detect data corruption on downloads, by comparing the hashes reported by
 *   the service against the computed values.
 * - Detect data corruption on uploads, by including the hashes with the upload,
 *   so the service can detect any differences.
 *
 * There are a number of caveats, as usual:
 *
 * - MD5 hashes are expensive to compute, and sometimes the service omits them.
 *   The library does not compute them unless explicitly asked by the
 *   application.
 * - The application may have computed the hashes already, or may have received
 *   them from the original source of the data, in which case we don't want to
 *   compute any hashes.
 * - With gRPC the hashes can be included at the end of an upload, but with REST
 *   we can only (a) read the data twice and include the hashes at the start
 *   of the upload, or (b) compare the computed hashes against the values
 *   reported by the service when the upload completes.
 *
 * This suggests a design that must support computing no hashes, one of the two
 * hash functions, or both hash functions. We use the [Composite] and
 * [Null Object] patterns to satisfy these requirements.
 *
 * [Composite]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern
 * [Null Object]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_object_pattern
