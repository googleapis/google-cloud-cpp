@defgroup storage-options GCS Client Library Configuration Options

The GCS client library uses the same mechanism as all other C++ client
libraries for configuration. As usual for the C++ client libraries, it adds a
number of unique options only applicable for the GCS library.

@see @ref options - for an overview of client library configuration.
