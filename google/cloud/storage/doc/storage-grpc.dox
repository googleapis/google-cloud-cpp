@page storage-grpc Using the GCS+gRPC Plugin

The GCS C++ client library includes an optional plugin to access GCS via gRPC.
When using GCS from Google Compute Engine (GCE) this plugin can enable higher
total throughput across large workloads that run on hundreds or thousands of
VMs.  Note that this feature is not GA. Consult with your account manager to be
included in the early access program.

## Release Notes

There are some features that the gRPC plugin does not implement or implements
differently from the REST-based implementation.

1. For best performance consider using Protobuf >= 23.2 and gRPC >= 1.55.0.
   Older versions of Protobuf requires enabling [ctype=CORD workarounds] at
   compile-time.
1. To override the default endpoint you should use
   [`EndpointOption`](@ref google::cloud::EndpointOption) instead of
   [`RestEndpointOption`](@ ref google::cloud::storage::RestEndpointOption).
1. The default endpoint (`storage.googleapis.com`) works from any hosting
   environment (on-prem, GKE, GCE, other cloud providers, etc.). For best
   performance on GCE or GKE consider using
   `google-c2p:///storage.googleapis.com`.
1. The [`Fields`](@ref google::cloud::storage::Fields) request parameter is
   passed verbatim to the backend. Some fields have different names in gRPC, and
   the backend does not translate them. This is a rarely used feature, and we do
   not anticipate the behavior change is likely to cause problems. If it does
   cause any issues please [file a bug].
1. All the `storage::Client::*AccessControl()` functions are emulated. For
   functions that change state, the emulation uses an [OCC loop]. While this
   preserves the semantics of a single RPC (e.g. no other concurrent changes
   are lost), it requires making at least two RPCs. This may increase the cost
   of calling these functions. Our telemetry shows these functions are not used
   via the C++ client library, but you should keep this in mind before deciding
   to use these functions in new code.

## Required code changes

To use GCS+gRPC plugin you need to make some changes to how your application
initializes the GCS C++ client library. First, an additional header provides
the initialization functions:

@snippet storage_grpc_samples.cc grpc-includes

Then you initialize a `google::cloud::storage::Client` using a new function:

@snippet storage_grpc_samples.cc grpc-default-client

The `google::cloud::storage::Client` object returned by this function can be
used as before:

@snippet storage_grpc_samples.cc grpc-read-write

## Changing your build scripts

If you are using CMake to compile your application, then you need to change the
`target_link_libraries()` command to use
`google-cloud-cpp::%experimental-storage-grpc` instead
of `google-cloud-cpp::%storage`. For example, our quickstart program for gRPC
uses:

```{.cmake}
add_executable(quickstart_grpc quickstart_grpc.cc)
target_link_libraries(quickstart_grpc google-cloud-cpp::experimental-storage-grpc)
```

If you are using Bazel to compile your application, then you need to change
the dependencies from `@google_cloud_cpp//:storage`
to `@google_cloud_cpp//:experimental-storage-grpc`.
For example, our `grpc/quickstart uses:

```{.py}
cc_binary(
    name = "quickstart_grpc",
    srcs = [
        "quickstart_grpc.cc",
    ],
    deps = [
        "@google_cloud_cpp//:experimental-storage-grpc",
    ],
)
```
