 * When using service account impersonation is important to distinguish between

 * @p base_credentials) parameter, and the credentials representing the
 * @p target_service_account.
 *
 * Use `AccessTokenLifetimeOption` to configure the maximum lifetime of the
 * obtained credentials.  The default is 1h (3600s), see [IAM quotas] for the
 * limits set by the platform and how to override them.

 * Use `DelegatesOption` to configure a sequence of intermediate service

/**
 * Creates service account credentials from a service account key.
 *
 * A [service account] is an account for an application or compute workload
 * instead of an individual end user. The recommended practice is to use
 * Google Default Credentials, which relies on the configuration of the Google
 * Cloud system hosting your application (GCE, GKE, Cloud Run) to authenticate
 * your workload or application.  But sometimes you may need to create and
 * download a [service account key], for example, to use a service account
 * when running your application on a system that is not part of Google Cloud.
 *
 * Service account credentials are used in this latter case.
 *
 * You can create multiple service account keys for a single service account.
 * When you create a service account key, the key is returned as string, in the
 * format described by [aip/4112]. This string contains an id for the service
 * account, as well as the cryptographical materials (a RSA private key)
 * required to authenticate the caller.
 *
 * Therefore, services account keys should be treated as any other secret
 * with security implications. Think of them as unencrypted passwords. Do not
 * store them where unauthorized persons or programs may read them.
 *
 * As stated above, most applications should probably use default credentials,
 * maybe pointing them to a file with these contents. Using this function may be
 * useful when the service account key is obtained from Cloud Secret Manager or
 * a similar service.

 * certificates and need to explicitly configure a root of trust.
 *
 * The value of this option should be the name of a file in [PEM format].
 * Consult your security team and/or system administrator for the contents of
 * this file. Be aware of the security implications of adding new CA
 * certificates to this file. Only use trustworthy sources for the CA
 * certificates.
 *
 * For REST-based libraries this configures the [CAINFO option] in libcurl.
 * These are used for all credentials that require authentication, including the
 * default credentials.
 *
 * For gRPC-based libraries this configures the `pem_roots_cert` parameter in
 * [grpc::SslCredentialsOptions].

 *     certificates for the default credentials. This option only has no effect
 *     with `MakeGoogleDefaultCredentials()`, or

 *     Consider using the `GRPC_DEFAULT_SSL_ROOTS_FILE_PATH` environment
