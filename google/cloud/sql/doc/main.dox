@mainpage Cloud SQL Admin API C++ Client Library

An idiomatic C++ client library for the [Cloud SQL Admin API][cloud-service-docs], a service
for Cloud SQL database instance management.

While this library is **GA**, please note that the Google Cloud C++ client
libraries do **not** follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Quickstart

The following shows the code that you'll run in the
`google/cloud/sql/quickstart/` directory,
which should give you a taste of the Cloud SQL Admin API C++ client library API.

## Main classes

<!-- inject-client-list-start -->
This library offers multiple `*Client` classes, which are listed below. Each one
of these classes exposes all the RPCs for a service as member functions of the
class. This library groups multiple services because they are part of the same
product or are often used together. A typical example may be the administrative
and data plane operations for a single product.

The library also has other classes that provide helpers, configuration
parameters, and infrastructure to mock the `*Client` classes when testing your
application.
