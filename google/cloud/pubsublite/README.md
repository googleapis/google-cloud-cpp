:construction:

[Cloud Pub/Sub Lite](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/lite/) is a high-volume
messaging service built for very low cost of operation by offering zonal storage
and pre-provisioned capacity.

This directory contains an idiomatic C++ client library for interacting with
this service.

This library is **experimental**. Its APIS are subject to change without notice.
